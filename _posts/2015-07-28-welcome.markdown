Welcome! I'm starting this site to share my knowledge of physics,
experiences developing software for scientific use, and anything
else that gets me excited. I am currently
a graduate student in the [physics department][3]
at [Cornell University][4] working with [Prof. Saul Teukolsky][5] with
the [SXS][6] collaboration. My research interests are solving
Einstein's equations using computers to study physics not available to
us here on Earth. Common examples of problems solved using numerical relativity
include binary black hole mergers, binary neutron star mergers, and jets
and acretion disk formation and evolution. Recently numerical
relativity has also been used to study quantum mechanical systems using
the so-called anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) conjecture.
If you have not heard of AdS/CFT fear not, I will have a post on this
at some stage but be warned that it is from the view of a relativist, not
a particle physicist.
