Welcome! Let me start with a brief history of me. I grew up in rural
Manitoba, Canada and did an undergraduate degree in [physics][1] at
[The University of Winnipeg][2]. I am now a graduate student in the
[physics department][3] at [Cornell University][4] working with
[Prof. Saul Teukolsky][5] as part of the [SXS][6] collaboration. My research
interests are in numerical solutions to partial differential equations (such as
the Einstein equations in general relativity), high performance C++ focusing on
peta- and exascale applications, and generative and metaprogramming. While my
graduate research focuses on numerical relativity, I really enjoy using
computational methods and tools to solve difficult science and technology
problems.
My numerical relativity interests are merging black holes and neutron
stars. However, the new code [SpECTRE][7] the SXS collaboration is developing
will be applicable to many more problems in astrophysics, such as core collapse
supernova simulations, and studying accretion disks around black holes.

In my "free" time I enjoy doing some hobby photography, going for runs, rock
climbing (as of recent), playing tennis, hockey, and guitar. In time I
will share some of my favorite pictures with you. When I'm not working
or exercising I really enjoy writing computer code, specifically for
scientific purposes such as solving partial differential
equations. I hope to some day actually organize my hobby projects under the
[Projects section](/projects/), but for now just check out my
[GitHub profile][8].
